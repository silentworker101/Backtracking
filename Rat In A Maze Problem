***///
You are given a N*N maze with a rat placed at maze[0][0]. Find and print all paths that rat can follow to reach its destination i.e. maze[N-1][N-1]. Rat can move in any direc­tion ( left, right, up and down).
Value of every cell in the maze can either be 0 or 1. Cells with value 0 are blocked means rat can­not enter into those cells and those with value 1 are open.
Input Format
Line 1 : Integer N
Next N Lines : Each line will contain ith row elements (separated by space)
Output Format :
One Line for every possible solution. 
Every line will have N*N maze elements printed row wise and are separated by space. Only cells that are part of solution path should be 1, rest all cells should be 0.
Sample Input 1 :
3
1 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
Sample Output 1 :
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 
Sample Output 1 Explanation :
Only 1 path is possible
Sample Input 2 :
3
1 0 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
Sample Output 2 :
1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 
1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 
1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 
Sample Output 2 Explanation :
4 paths are possible
